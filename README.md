# mycenaean-dictionary-and-translation-tool
mycenaean dictionary and translation tool works by taking an input in english then translating to ancient greek and then taking that word and writing it in the greek alphabet and the linear b syllabet and outputs all of those. I am not a linguist so if you see any errors in the syllbet please let me know. The program cannot handle sentence but part two with a graphical interface and sentence handling capabilities.
